.. start-intro

This project provides a wrapped version (using the `babelizer <https://babelizer.readthedocs.io>`_ tool)
of components within the following following libraries that expose a Basic Model Interface.
This allows these components to be imported and used within
Python and the Python Modeling Toolkit, PyMT.

Quickstart
==========

.. start-quickstart

To get started you will need to install the *{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}* package, which is currently distributed
on *conda-forge*. The easiest way to install *{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}* into your current environment using either *mamba* or *conda*.

.. tab:: mamba

  .. code:: bash

    mamba install {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}

.. tab:: conda

  .. code:: bash

    conda install {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}

.. end-quickstart

Usage
=====

.. start-usage

There are two ways to use the data components provided by this package: directly through it's Basic
Model Interface, or as a PyMT plugin.

A BMI is provided by each component in this package:
{%- for babelized_class, component in cookiecutter.components|dictsort -%}
:class:`~{{ cookiecutter.package_name}}.{{ babelized_class }}`
{% endfor %}.


{% for babelized_class, component in cookiecutter.components|dictsort -%}

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from {{ cookiecutter.package_name}} import {{ babelized_class }}
  >>> model = {{ babelized_class }}()
  >>> model.get_component_name()  # Get the name of the component
  >>> model.get_output_var_names()  # Get a list of the component's output variables

The PyMT provides a more Pythonic and convenient way to use the component,

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from pymt.models import {{ babelized_class }}
  >>> model = {{ babelized_class }}()
  >>> model.component_name
  >>> model.output_var_names

{% endfor %}


.. note::

  If you will be using this project's components through the PyMT, you will first need to install
  PyMT. This can be done using either *mamba* or *conda*.

  .. tab:: mamba

    .. code-block:: bash

      mamba install pymt -c conda-forge

  .. tab:: conda

      .. code-block:: bash

        conda install pymt -c conda-forge


.. end-usage


Updating
========

.. start-updating

This project has been automatically generated using the `babelizer <https://babelizer.readthedocs.io>`_ tool.
If you have made changes to the project's ``babel.toml`` file or the would like to rerender the project
with a newer version of the *babelizer*, you can do this either directly with the *babelize* command
or using *nox*.

.. warning::

  Many of the files in the project are auto-generated by the *babelizer* and so any changes that you've
  made to them will likely be lost after running the following commands.

.. tab:: nox

  .. code:: bash

    nox -s update

.. tab:: babelizer

  .. code:: bash

    babelize update


.. end-updating

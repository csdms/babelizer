Quickstart
==========

.. note::

    The following commands will install *{{ package.name}}* into your current
    environment. Although not necessary, we **highly recommend** you install
    *{{ package.name}}* into its own
    :ref:`virtual environment <virtual_environments>`.

.. include:: ../README.rst
    :start-after: .. start-quickstart
    :end-before: .. end-quickstart

If you would like the very latest development version of *{{ package.name}}*
or want to modify or contribute code to the *{{ package.name}}* project,
you will need to do a :ref:`developer installation <developer_install>` of
*{{ package.name }}* from source.

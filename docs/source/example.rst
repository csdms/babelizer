Example: Wrapping a C model
===========================

In this example, we'll use the *babelizer*
to wrap the *heat* model from the `bmi-example-c`_ repository,
allowing it to be run in Python.
The model and its BMI are written in C.
To simplify package management in the example,
we'll use :term:`conda`.
We'll also use :term:`git` to obtain the model source code.

This is a somewhat long example.
To break it up,
here are the steps we'll take:

#. Create a :term:`conda environment` that includes software to compile the
   model and wrap it with the *babelizer*
#. Clone the `bmi-example-c`_ repository from GitHub and build the
   *heat* model from source
#. Create a *babelizer* input file describing the *heat* model
#. Run the *babelizer* to generate Python bindings, then build the bindings
#. Show the *heat* model running in Python through *pymt*

Before we begin,
create a directory to hold our work:

.. code:: bash

  $ mkdir build && cd build


Set up a conda environment
--------------------------

Start by setting up a :term:`conda environment` that includes the *babelizer*,
as well as a toolchain to build and install the model.
The necessary packages are listed in the conda environment file
:download:`environment.yml`:

.. include:: environment.yml
   :literal:

:download:`Download <environment.yml>` this file
and create the new environment with:

.. code:: bash

  $ conda env create --file=environment.yml

When this command completes,
activate the environment
(on Linux and macOS, you may have to use ``source`` instead of ``conda``):

.. code:: bash

  $ conda activate wrap

The *wrap* environment now contains all the dependencies needed
to build, install, and wrap the *heat* model.


Build the *heat* model from source
----------------------------------

Clone the `bmi-example-c`_ repository from GitHub:

.. code:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/csdms/bmi-example-c

There are general `instructions`_ in the repository for building and installing
this package on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
We'll augment those instructions
with the note that we're installing into the *wrap* conda environment,
so the ``CONDA_PREFIX`` environment variable
should be used to specify the install path.

Linux and macOS
...............

On Linux and macOS,
use these commands to build and install the *heat* model:

.. code:: bash

  $ cd bmi-example-c
  $ mkdir _build && cd _build
  $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX
  $ make
  $ make install

Verify the install by testing for the existence of the header
of the library containing the compiled *heat* model:

.. code:: bash

  $ test -f $CONDA_PREFIX/include/bmi_heat.h

Windows
.......

Building on Windows requires
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017.
To build and install the *heat* model,
the following commands must be run in a `Developer Command Prompt`_:

.. code::

  > cd bmi-example-c
  > mkdir _build && cd _build
  > cmake .. ^
      -G "NMake Makefiles" ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%CONDA_PREFIX% ^
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  > cmake --build . --target install --config Release

Verify the install by testing for the existence of the header
of the library containing the compiled *heat* model:

.. code::

  > if not exist %LIBRARY_INC%\\bmi_heat.h exit 1 

Create the *babelizer* input file
---------------------------------

The *babelizer* input file provides information to the *babelizer*
about the model to be wrapped.
The input file is created with the ``babelize generate`` subcommand.

Return to our initial ``build`` directory and call ``babelize generate`` with:

.. code:: bash

  $ cd ~/build
  $ babelize generate \
      --package=pymt_heatc \
      --summary="PyMT plugin for heat model" \
      --language=c \
      --library=bmiheatc \
      --header=bmi_heat.h \
      --entry-point=register_bmi_heat \
      --name=HeatModel \
      --requirement="" > babel_heatc.toml

In this call,
the *babelizer* will also fill in default values
for author name, author email, GitHub username, and license.

The resulting file, :download:`babel_heatc.toml`,
will look something like this:

.. include:: babel_heatc.toml
   :literal:

For more information on the entries and sections of the *babelizer* input file,
see `Input file <./readme.html#input-file>`_.


Wrap the model with the *babelizer*
-----------------------------------

Generate Python bindings for the model with the ``babelize init`` subcommand:

.. code:: bash

  $ babelize init babel_heatc.toml

The results are placed in a new directory, ``pymt_heatc``,
under the current directory.

.. code:: bash

  $ ls -aF pymt_heatc
  ./                        MANIFEST.in               recipe/
  ../                       Makefile                  requirements-build.txt
  .git/                     README.rst                requirements-library.txt
  .github/                  babel.toml                requirements-testing.txt
  .gitignore                docs/                     requirements.txt
  CHANGES.rst               meta/                     setup.cfg
  CREDITS.rst               pymt_heatc/               setup.py
  LICENSE                   pyproject.toml

Before we can build the Python bindings,
we must ensure that the dependencies required by the toolchain,
as well as any required by the model,
as specified in the *babelizer* input file (none in this case),
are satisfied.

Change to the ``pymt_heatc`` directory and install dependencies
into the conda environment:

.. code:: bash

  $ cd pymt_heatc
  $ conda install -c conda-forge \
      --file=requirements-build.txt \
      --file=requirements-testing.txt \
      --file=requirements-library.txt \
      --file=requirements.txt

Now build the Python bindings with:

.. code:: bash

  $ make install

This command sets off a long list of messages,
at the end of which you'll hopefully see:

.. code:: bash

  Successfully installed pymt-heatc

Pause a moment to see what we've done.
Change back to the initial ``build`` directory,
make a new ``test`` directory,
and change to it:

.. code:: bash

  $ cd ~/build
  $ mkdir test && cd test

Start a Python session and try the following commands:

.. code:: python

  >>> from pymt_heatc import HeatModel
  >>> m = HeatModel()
  >>> print(m.get_component_name())
  The 2D Heat Equation

We've imported the *heat* model,
written in C,
into Python!

At this point,
it's a good idea to run the *bmi-tester* (`GitHub repo <bmi-tester>`_)
over the model.
The *bmi-tester* exercises each BMI method exposed through Python,
ensuring it works correctly.
However, before running the *bmi-tester*,
one last piece of information is needed.
Like all models equipped with a BMI,
*heat* uses a :term:`configuration file` to specify initial parameter values.
Download the file :download:`config.txt <examples/config.txt>` for use here.

Run the *bmi-tester* with:

.. code:: bash

  $ bmi-test pymt_heatc:HeatModel --config-file=config.txt --root-dir=. -vvv

This command sets off a long list of messages,
ending with

.. code:: bash

  ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!
  
if everything has been built correctly.


Add metadata to make a *pymt* component
---------------------------------------

The final step in wrapping the *heat* model
is to add metadata used by the `Python Modeling Tool`_, *pymt*.
CSDMS develops a set of standards,
the `CSDMS Model Metadata`_,
that provides a detailed and formalized description of a model.
The metadata allow *heat* to be run and and :term:`coupled <model coupling>`
with other models that expose a BMI and have been similarly wrapped
with the *babelizer*.

Recall the *babelizer* outputs the wrapped *heat* model
to the directory ``pymt_heatc``.
Under this directory,
the *babelizer* created a directory for *heat* model metadata,
``meta/HeatModel``.
Change back to the ``pymt_heatc`` directory
and view the current metadata:

.. code:: bash

  $ cd ~/build/pymt_heatc
  $ ls meta/HeatModel/
  api.yaml

The file ``api.yaml`` is automatically generated by the *babelizer*.
To complete the description of the *heat* model,
other metadata files are needed, including:

* :download:`info.yaml <examples/info.yaml>`
* :download:`run.yaml <examples/run.yaml>`
* a :download:`templated model configuration file <examples/heat.txt>`
* :download:`parameters.yaml <examples/parameters.yaml>`

`Descriptions`_ of these files and their roles
are given in the CSDMS Model Metadata repository.
Download each of the files using the links in the list above
and place them in the ``pymt_heatc/meta/HeatModel`` directory
alongside ``api.yaml``.

Next, install *pymt*:

.. code:: bash

  $ conda install -c conda-forge pymt

Then start a Python session and show that the *heat* model
can be called through *pymt*:

.. code:: python

  >>> from pymt.models import HeatModel
  >>> m = HeatModel()
  >>> print(m.name)
  The 2D Heat Equation

A longer example,
:download:`pymt_heatc_ex.py <examples/pymt_heatc_ex.py>`,
is included in the documentation.
For easy viewing, it's reproduced here verbatim:

.. include:: examples/pymt_heatc_ex.py
   :literal:

:download:`Download <examples/pymt_heatc_ex.py>` this Python script,
then run it with:

.. code:: bash

  $ python pymt_heatc_ex.py


Summary
-------

Using the *babelizer*, we wrapped the *heat* model, which is written in C.
It can now be called as a *pymt* component in Python.

The steps for wrapping a model with the *babelizer* outlined in this example
can also be applied to models written in C++ and Fortran.
